# File-structures-mini-project
This project is aimed at developing an online Library Management System for the college library and developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. This project mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new member, new books, and updating new information, searching books and members, issuing books, deleting books and facility to borrow and return books. This application is password protected so that only authorized persons can have access to the system. This project has many features which are generally not availiable in normal library management systems like facility of user login and a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system. It has also a facility where we can see the list of books issued. It also has different categories like Computer, Electroincs, Electricals, Civil, Mechanical and Architecture. The add book module contains separate divisions like book ID, book name, author name, quantity, price and rack number. Both deleting and searching of books is based on two different parameters like search by ID and search by name so we conveniently perform the operations. Overall this project of mine is being developed to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
